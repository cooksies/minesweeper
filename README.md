# How to play

To begin, choose the difficulty you want to play
- Easy: 9x9
- Medium: 16x16
- Hard: 30x16

Reveal a tile by left-clicking on it. But be careful! It may also be hiding a bomb.\
If you suspect that a tile may be a bomb, you can right click on the tile to place a flag on it. This helps as a marker and prevent you from accidentally clicking it. You can unflag a tile by right-clicking on the flagged tile.

Some tiles will reveal numbers. These number indicate how many bombs is surrounding it. The bomb can be to its adjacent neighbouring tiles and the tiles diagonal from it. It is up to your judgement where the bomb may be.

The game ends once you reveal all tiles without the bombs or if you hit a bomb.\
To replay the game, simply click the smiley face again and reset the whole board.
